# How to implement mail merge in a RichEditControl


<p>This example illustrates an older approach to implement mail merge in the <strong>RichEditControl</strong>.<br />
To learn about a newer and more convenient approach to <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument16044"><u>master-detail mail merge</u></a>, refer to <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/CodeCentral/ViewExample.aspx?exampleId=E5078"><u>How to automatically create mail-merge documents using the Snap Document Server</u></a>.</p><p><br />
In this example, the <strong>ArrayList</strong> that is generated at runtime is used as a data source that supplies mail merge data to the document. The tab control on the form contains a <a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#WindowsForms/CustomDocument9551"><u>Ribbon UI</u></a> and two <strong>RichEditControl</strong> instances (one of them is used to construct a document template, and the other displays the mail merge result).</p>
